        <p class="aboutme">
            I am a scientist by profession. I have a BS degree in biology with a minor in chemistry from the 90's. My current job is working in a medical lab. Some of my duties include drawing blood, and the testing of the blood or stool. Sometime in the near future I hope to be able to work from home doing web design and development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a great sense of adventure and love the outdoors. Being outdoors is what makes me happy. Getting outside and doing any activity makes my soul sing. I enjoy running, hiking and biking during every season.
        </p>
        <p>
            My family consists of a great husband (most of the time), and two children. The oldest is 27 years old and have a passion for life. She enjoys dressing up and going to festivals. My youngest just graduated from FVTC with a transfer degree. She is current at UWGB to get their BS.
